Nix is a package manager that features interesting characteristics.  
What I think is interesting:
* Reproducibility
* Portability

As a non developer, with little familiarity with package management and system administration, starting doing something with Nix requires an immeasurable amount of time and pain. You might say, why still persisting in this direction ? The answers are simple, Nix can help me:
* Solve problems I might personnaly face in the future and save me an **EVEN MORE HIGHER** amount of time and pain
* Propose a consistent, robust answers to people's problem and thus save **EVEN MORE OF OTHER's** time and pain

This repository is just a a collection of notes, taken here and there and organize into Nix ultra basic cookbooks. I'm using the term "learning pills" in reference to (Nix pills)[https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills/]. 

All in all, it is my personal attempt to overcome this painful learning curve hoping that it will be beneficial some days.
