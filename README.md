# floui-nix-learning-pills
`[Nix](https://nixos.org/)` is a package manager that features interesting characteristics.  
What I think is interesting:
* Reproducibility
* Portability

As a non developer, with little familiarity with package management and system administration, starting doing something with `Nix` requires an immeasurable amount of time and pain. You might say, why still persisting in this direction ? The answers are simple, `Nix` can help me:
* Solves problems I might face in the near future and helps save me an **EVEN MORE HIGHER** amount of time and pain
* Propose a consistent, robust answers to people's problem and thus save **EVEN MORE OF OTHER's** time and pain

This repository is just a a collection of notes, taken [here](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable) and [there](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable) and organized into Nix ultra basic cookbooks. I'm using the term "learning pills" in reference to [Nix pills](https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills/). 

All in all, it is my personal attempt to overcome this learning curve hoping that it will be beneficial some days.
